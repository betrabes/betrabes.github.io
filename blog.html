    <p>
      I had a lot of trouble setting up my enviornment for this assignment.
      I had to install atom and use terminal commands to commit my webpage
      to github. I had to go back to the lecture notes and lecture videos
      in order to correctly configure my enviornment. I learned how to use
      basic html to set up a basic website. I had to go back and see the syntax
      for setting up paragraphs and different headers. I also spent a lot of time trying
      to figure out why my website was not showing up, when I had not saved my progress.
      I did not really know how to do any of this before, so I am excited to learn
      and add more features. The lecture notes and the recorded Zoom lectures were the
      best resources for this assignment.

    <p>
      I found using element selectors to be very hard. I had trouble implementing
      the different selectors for the assignment from the html code. I learned
      how to properly use CSS and came to the insight that it was more complicated
      than I thought. I used the lecture notes as well as google as resources.
      Next time I will use the TAs for my questions. I had to google how to get rid
      of bullet points and how to use references for css.

    <h2> Blog for Assignment 3 - 5/11/2020 </h2>
    <p>
      I had a lot of trouble with this assignment due to the complexity. I did not know
      how to use the functions for the program. I learned how to break dwon the problem and look
      back at previous examples in order to paint a picture of what to do. I had
      learn how to utilize and combine both the html and javascript code into
      a final product.
