    <h2> Blog for Assignment 1 - 4/8/2020 </h2>
    <p>
      I had a lot of trouble setting up my enviornment for this assignment.
      I had to install atom and use terminal commands to commit my webpage
      to github. I had to go back to the lecture notes and lecture videos
      in order to correctly configure my enviornment. I learned how to use
      basic html to set up a basic website. I had to go back and see the syntax
      for setting up paragraphs and different headers. I also spent a lot of time trying
      to figure out why my website was not showing up, when I had not saved my progress.
      I did not really know how to do any of this before, so I am excited to learn
      and add more features. The lecture notes and the recorded Zoom lectures were the
      best resources for this assignment.

    <h2> Blog for Assignment 2 - 4/27/2020 </h2>
    <p>
      I found using element selectors to be very hard. I had trouble implementing
      the different selectors for the assignment from the html code. I learned
      how to properly use CSS and came to the insight that it was more complicated
      than I thought. I used the lecture notes as well as google as resources.
      Next time I will use the TAs for my questions. I had to google how to get rid
      of bullet points and how to use references for css.

    <h2> Blog for Assignment 3 - 5/11/2020 </h2>
    <p>
      I had a lot of trouble with this assignment due to the complexity. I did not know
      how to use the functions for the program. I learned how to break down the problem and look
      back at previous examples in order to paint a picture of what to do. I had
      learn how to utilize and combine both the html and javascript code into
      a final product.

    <h2> Blog for Assignment 4 - 5/18/2020 </h2>
    <p>
      This assignment was interesting because it was not client side. I had to google all
      the different commands for node.js that I had difficulty with. I also had to go back
      to the lecture to review some concepts that I was struggling with. I learnt how servers
      work at a basic level. I was challenged by actually having to create a server and actuallu
      complete the assigned tasks. Overall this assignment was challenging.

    <h2> Blog for Assignment 5 - 6/3/2020 </h2>
    <p>
      This assignment was challenging because there were a lot of moving parts. I had to focus
      on many different files for this assignment, when in other assignments I just had to focus
      on one. This assignment felt like putting different parts of previous assignments together
      which was completely different then what I had previously done. I had trouble figuring out
      how to implement a template in the different scenarios. I had to go back to the lecture notes
      and the lecture code in order to see how to make it al work. Overall this assignment was interesting
      and challenging.

    <h2> Blog about Speech and Debate - 12/4/2020 </h2>
    <p>
      This blog post is going to be about how speech and debate is relavent to my major of computer science.
      Oftentime, in speech and debate I have to limit myself and only talk about the most important points.
      In debate I only have a limited amount of time to give a constructive speech and address my opponent's points.
      Therefore, I have to learn to prioritize what is important and how much time I want to spend giving a rebuttel
      or adding on to my own speech. The same thing is true with technical meetings. When I am meeting with my team members
      on my capstone project, we only have a limited amount of time to talk about the technical details. I have to make
      sure what I say is only the most crucial point that my team has to know about. I do not want to just ramble on about
      my struggles with programming or the research that I have done. I want to try to stick to a couple of sentences which
      will allow me to fully update my team on my progress. Speaking succinctly is really important in both debate and
      technical communciation because people will stop listening to you if you drone on about something that does not interest them
      or impact their lives in any way. Therefore, I have to keep my audience engaged by telling them how what I am saying is relavent
      to their lives. Overall, the Speech and Debate team is really good practice for helping with my technical communication skills.
