    <p>
      I had a lot of trouble setting up my enviornment for this assignment.
      I had to install atom and use terminal commands to commit my webpage
      to github. I had to go back to the lecture notes and lecture videos
      in order to correctly configure my enviornment. I learned how to use
      basic html to set up a basic website. I had to go back and see the syntax
      for setting up paragraphs and different headers. I also spent a lot of time trying
      to figure out why my website was not showing up, when I had not saved my progress.
      I did not really know how to do any of this before, so I am excited to learn
      and add more features. The lecture notes and the recorded Zoom lectures were the
      best resources for this assignment.
